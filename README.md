# Crude OCR - Final Project for PDM - Semester 1
Crude OCR is an OCR interpretation using Machine Learning as a base. It will be able to interpret text from a written document in the form of a PNG or JPG file, as well as straight from the webcam. Results from the analyzation will be in the form of plain text, which can then be copied for further use. There will also be an option for the text to be read aloud through text-to-speech.
